STEP 1: Connect to a VPN (US Preferably)
STEP 2: Connect Wireshark to WIFI/Ethernet (Not VPN)
STEP 3: Go to amazon.com 
STEP 4: Apply filter "esp"
STEP 5: Don't try "ah" as issue due to VPN (not supported)


Theory: 
1. IPsec (Internet Protocol Security): 
• A suite of protocols used to secure IP communication. 
• Operates at the Network Layer of the OSI model. 
• Provides: 
o Authentication (verifies sender identity). 
o Confidentiality (encrypts data). 
o Integrity (ensures data is not tampered). 
o Anti-replay protection (prevents duplicate packets). 
IPsec works in two modes: 
• Transport Mode → Only the payload of the IP packet is protected. 
• Tunnel Mode → The entire IP packet is protected and encapsulated inside a new IP packet. 

2. IPsec Protocols: 
(a) Authentication Header (AH): 
• Provides data integrity and authentication of IP packets. 
• Protects the entire packet (header + payload) except fields that change in transit (like 
TTL). 
• Does not provide encryption (no confidentiality). 
• Protocol number: 51.
(b) Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP): 
• Provides encryption (confidentiality), authentication, and integrity. 
• Protects only the payload, not the outer IP header. 
• Protocol number: 50.
