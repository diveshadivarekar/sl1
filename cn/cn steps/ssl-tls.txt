STEP 1: go to amazon.com {ecomm/bank website}..
STEP 2: ADD Filter "tls" (For SSL/TLS traffic)
STEP 3: Search/Manually Look for "Client Hello" & "Server Hello"

For HTTPS specifically
tcp.port == 443


Theory:

SSL Protocol 
• SSL (Secure Socket Layer) is a cryptographic protocol that provides secure communication 
over the internet. 
• It ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authentication by encrypting data exchanged between 
the client and the server. 
• Modern websites use TLS (Transport Layer Security), which is the successor of SSL, but the 
term SSL is still commonly used. 
• SSL works over TCP and is widely used in HTTPS (Port 443). 

Key Features of SSL/TLS: 
1. Handshake Process – Client and server agree on encryption methods and exchange keys. 
2. Encryption – Data is encrypted before transmission to prevent eavesdropping. 
3. Authentication – The server presents a digital certificate to prove its identity. 
4. Integrity – Data integrity is ensured using hashing techniques. 

Why SSL is important: 
• Protects sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, and personal details. 
• Prevents attacks such as man-in-the-middle (MITM) and eavesdropping. 
• Builds user trust in online banking, e-commerce, and other secure applications.
