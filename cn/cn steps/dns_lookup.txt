python code for DNS:

import socket 
 
def forward_lookup(domain): 
    try: 
        ip = socket.gethostbyname(domain) 
        print(f"IP Address of {domain}: {ip}") 
    except socket.gaierror: 
        print("Host not found.") 
 
def reverse_lookup(ip_address): 
    try: 
        host = socket.gethostbyaddr(ip_address) 
        print(f"Host Name of {ip_address}: {host[0]}") 
    except socket.herror: 
        print("Host not found.")

def main(): 
    print("DNS Lookup Program") 
    print("1. Forward Lookup (Domain → IP)") 
    print("2. Reverse Lookup (IP → Domain)") 
 
    choice = input("Enter your choice (1/2): ") 
 
    if choice == '1': 
        domain = input("Enter Domain Name: ") 
        forward_lookup(domain) 
    elif choice == '2': 
        ip_address = input("Enter IP Address: ") 
        reverse_lookup(ip_address) 
    else: 
        print("Invalid choice. Exiting.") 
 
if __name__ == "__main__": 
    main() 


Theory: 

What is DNS? 
The Domain Name System (DNS) is one of the most critical parts of the Internet. It works like a 
telephone directory that translates human-readable domain names (e.g., www.google.com) into IP 
addresses (e.g., 142.250.190.36) that computers and networking devices use to identify each other. 
Without DNS, users would need to remember long numeric IP addresses for every website, which 
is impractical. 
DNS Working Process 
When you type a web address into a browser, the following steps occur: 
1. Browser Cache Check – The browser first checks if it already knows the IP address from a 
recent visit. 
2. Operating System Cache Check – If not found, the OS checks its local DNS cache. 
3. DNS Resolver (ISP’s DNS Server) – If not cached locally, the request is sent to the DNS 
resolver of your Internet Service Provider (ISP). 
4. Recursive Query to DNS Hierarchy: 
o Root DNS Servers → Provide the address of the Top-Level Domain (TLD) server 
(e.g., .com). 
o TLD DNS Servers → Provide the address of the authoritative server for the domain. 
o Authoritative DNS Server → Provides the final IP address of the requested domain. 
5. The IP address is returned to the client, and the browser uses it to establish a connection (e.g., 
via TCP/IP) with the website’s server. 

Types of DNS Queries 
1. Forward Lookup (Name to IP): 
Class: T.E.                                      
Roll No: 3078 
o The most common query where the domain name is given, and the DNS returns the 
corresponding IP address. 
o Example: www.google.com → 142.250.190.36 
2. Reverse Lookup (IP to Name): 
o A query where the IP address is given, and the DNS returns the corresponding 
domain name (if available). 
o Uses PTR records (Pointer records). 
o Example: 142.250.190.36 → maa05s47-in-f36.1e100.net 
DNS Records 
DNS servers store information in the form of resource records: 
• A Record (Address Record): Maps a domain name to an IPv4 address. 
• AAAA Record: Maps a domain name to an IPv6 address. 
• CNAME Record (Canonical Name): Maps one domain name to another (alias). 
• MX Record (Mail Exchange): Specifies the mail server responsible for a domain. 
• PTR Record (Pointer Record): Used for reverse lookup (IP → Domain). 
• NS Record (Name Server): Identifies the authoritative name servers for a domain. 
DNS Lookup in Programming 
• Forward DNS Lookup: Uses functions like gethostbyname() (in Python/Java) to resolve a 
domain name into its IP address. 
• Reverse DNS Lookup: Uses functions like gethostbyaddr() to resolve an IP address back 
into a hostname. 
• These system calls internally communicate with the OS resolver, which queries DNS servers 
if needed.
