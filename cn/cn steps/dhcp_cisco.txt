Step 1: Get Switch PT, PC_1 , PC_2, Server
Step 2: Get all Wired Connections
STEP 3: Go to Server>Services>DHCP >Service (ON) 
STEP 4: Start IP add: 169:254:0:0 subnet : 255:255:0:0 Click on Add
STEP 5: Go to PC_1 , PC_2 , Server > Config > IP Configuration > Set to DHCP (it will auto take ip)
STEP 6: Go to PC_1 > Desktop > CMD
A) ping {ip of PC_2}
B) ipconfig
check if IPv4 Address is Autoconfigured...


Theory: 
1. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol): 
• DHCP is a network management protocol used to dynamically assign IP addresses and 
other network settings (like DNS, gateway, subnet mask) to client machines. 
• Operates at the Application Layer. 
• Uses UDP port 67 (server) and UDP port 68 (client). 
2. DHCP Working Steps (DORA Process): 
1. Discover → Client broadcasts a DHCP Discover message to find servers. 
2. Offer → DHCP server responds with an Offer (IP + configuration). 
3. Request → Client requests the offered IP address. 
4. Acknowledge → Server acknowledges and assigns the IP address to the client.
