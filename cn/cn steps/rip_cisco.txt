Setup 

PC1 — Switch — R1 — R2 — Switch — PC2

Device	Interface	IP Address	Subnet Mask	Description
PC1	NIC	192.168.10.2	255.255.255.0	Connected to R1 LAN
R1	Fa0/0	192.168.10.1	255.255.255.0	LAN (to PC1)
R1	Fa0/1	10.0.0.1	255.255.255.252	Link to R2
R2	Fa0/0	192.168.20.1	255.255.255.0	LAN (to PC2)
R2	Fa0/1	10.0.0.2	255.255.255.252	Link to R1
PC2	NIC	192.168.20.2	255.255.255.0	Connected to R2 LAN


Step 1: Get 2 routers, 2 switches & 2 routers
Step 2: Connect devices:
PC1 ↔ Switch1 ↔ R1 (Fa0/0)
R1 (Fa0/1) ↔ R2 (Fa0/1)
R2 (Fa0/0) ↔ Switch2 ↔ PC2
(Use copper straight-through cables for PCs/switches and crossover for router-to-router if required.)

Step 3: Router (R1)

enable
conf t
hostname R1
interface fa0/0
 ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
exit
interface fa0/1
 ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.252
 no shutdown
exit

Step 4: Router (R2)
enable
conf t
hostname R2
interface fa0/0
 ip address 192.168.20.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
exit
interface fa0/1
 ip address 10.0.0.2 255.255.255.252
 no shutdown
exit


Step 5: RIP Router R1

router rip
version 2
no auto-summary
network 192.168.10.0
network 10.0.0.0
exit

(useless code just use RIP GUI to add both network)

Step 6: RIP Router R2

router rip
version 2
no auto-summary
network 192.168.20.0
network 10.0.0.0
exit

(useless code just use RIP GUI to add both network)

Step 7: IMPPP - Configure PCs
PC 1 - Default Gateway: 192.168.10.1
PC 2 - Default Gateway: 192.168.20.1

Step 8: Verify Config

Go to router CLI

"show ip route"

Step 9: Go to PC1>Desktop>CMD
Write ping "IP_PC2"

Simulate & bingo!!!!


Theory:

The Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is one of the oldest distance-vector routing 
protocols which employ the hop count as a routing metric. RIP prevents routing loops by 
implementing a limit on the number of hops allowed in a path from source to destination. The 
maximum number of hops allowed for RIP is 15, which limits the size of networks that RIP 
can support. A hop count of 16 is considered an infinite distance and the route is considered 
unreachable. RIP implements the split horizon, route poisoning and hold down mechanisms to 
prevent incorrect routing information from being propagated. 
Originally, each RIP router transmitted full updates every 30 seconds. In the early 
deployments, routing tables were small enough that the traffic was not significant.  As networks 
grew in size, however, it became evident there could be a massive traffic burst every 30 
seconds, even if the routers had been initialized at random times. It was thought, as a result of 
random initialization, the routing updates would spread out in time, but this was not true in 
practice. Sally Floyd and Van Jacobson showed in 1994 that, without slight randomization of 
the update timer, the timers synchronized over time.
